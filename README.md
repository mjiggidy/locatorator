# locatorator

`locatorator` is an unfortuantely-named script designed to find differences between two Avid marker lists.  For example, if a marker with a VFX ID in the comment is placed on each VFX shot, this could be helpful to determine where cut changes have occurred and which VFX shots may be affected.

`locatorator` will display the changes on-screen, as well as output a new marker list that can be imported into the new sequence to call out changes.

## Usage
Once installed, `locatorator` can be used in the following way:

- Export a marker list from the old version of your sequence.

- Export a marker list from the new version of your sequence.

- Run locatorator with the following syntax:
```python
locatorator old_sequence_markerlist.txt new_sequence_markerlist.txt
```

- Use the print-out in the Terminal window, or

- Import the newly-created `changes.txt` marker list into your new sequence
