# locatorator

`locatorator` is an unfortunately-named script designed to find differences between two Avid marker lists.  For example, if a marker with a VFX ID in the comment is placed on each VFX shot, this could be helpful to determine where cut changes have occurred and which VFX shots may be affected.

`locatorator` will display the changes on-screen, as well as output a new marker list that can be imported into the new sequence to call out changes.

Updated documentation coming soon.
